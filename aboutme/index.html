      <p>Hello everybody! My name is Alejandro Garcia, 
      I am from Veracruz which is a city in the southern 
      Gulf of Mexico. I enjoy weightlifting at the gym and
      at the beach, running in parks and by the costal line,
      playing basketball, and going to the theater and 
      chilling at cafes with friends and family. I also 
      enjoy watching videos, series or playing videogames 
      with futuristic themes that analyze or portray 
      advancements in technology and their effect on 
      society (institutions, finances, spoken values, 
      acted values, governments, communication, etc.) 
      I have special interest on Eve Online, lately the
      Fallout show has been pretty good, Halo is a classic...
      If anyone likes or knows other related things please
      hit me up, I would love to chat and be friends!</p>

      <p>My major is Software Engineering because I love thinking,
      solving puzzles and having meaningful conversations that
      make my brain tickle haha. I am working on a software 
      development portfolio using previous knowledge, YouTube,
      and Codecademy if there is anyone doing any similar thing
      I would love to chat just to share ideas and encourage each other.
      I hope we have a fun class!</p>
